  "description": "Yann LeCun, Courant Institute, NYU\nCorinna Cortes, Google Labs, New York\nChristopher J.C. Burges, Microsoft Research, Redmond\nThe MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.\nIt is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.",
